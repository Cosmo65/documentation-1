# Form validation

We recommend using HTML5 validation that is built into the browser. HTML5 validation is very rich these days, and has good browser support.

HTML5 form validation resources:

- [MDN: Form data validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Form_validation)
- [HTML5 validation browser support](https://caniuse.com/#search=validation)
- [MDNT: the input element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)
