# Direct replies

When email notifications are enabled, Formspark enables you to directly "Reply" to the person who originally submitted the form.

The form must contain an input with a "\_replyto" or "email" name.

```html
<input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your email" />
```

```html
<input type="text" name="_replyto" placeholder="Your email" />
```
