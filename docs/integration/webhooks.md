# Webhooks

Formspark can send webhook events that notify your application any time you receive a form submission.

To set up an endpoint:

1. Define an endpoint on your server for receiving events, this route should listen for `POST` events and return a `200` status code.
2. Paste the endpoint into the `Webhook URL` field found in your form's settings.
3. Submit to your form and verify your endpoint is receiving submissions successfully.

:::tip
You can use a service such as [requestcatcher.com](https://requestcatcher.com) to test the integration with your form.
:::

Your endpoint's length should not exceed 512 characters.

To stop using webhooks, clear the `Webhook URL` field found in your form's settings.
