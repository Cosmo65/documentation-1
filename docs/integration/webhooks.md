# Webhooks

Formspark can send webhook events that notify your application any time you receive a form submission.

To set up an endpoint:

1. Define an endpoint on your server for receiving events, this route should listen for `POST` events and return a `200` status code.
2. Paste the endpoint into the `Webhook URL` field found in your form's settings.
3. Submit to your form and verify your endpoint is receiving submissions successfully.

Formspark will retry calling your webhook up to 10 times, every 15 minutes, until your webhook returns a `200` status code.

We only send submissions that are not spam to your webhook.

Your endpoint's length should not 512 characters.

To stop using webhooks, clear the `Webhook URL` field found in your form's settings.
